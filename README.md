# Small-Mods
Collection of small geode mods, to make my github a bit more clean!

Hide Attempts: hides the attempt label, so it doesnt cover the level.

NoParticles: deletes all the particles (wow).

NoRotation: The player (any mode) doesnt rotate.

Verify Hack: you dont need to verify your created levels.

NoTransition: Disables the transition fade, so the game looks smoother.

Auto LDM: Auto enables the Low Detail Mode in every level (even in the editor).

NoTrail: removes the trail on every gamemode.
